INTEREST COMPUND CALCUATOR
by : Sarron Tadesse

This is our vibrant Compound Interest Calculator!!
It asks the user for four inputs:
-The principal amount,
-The number of times its compounded per year,
-The total number of years, and
-The interest rate in percentages.

The Compound Interest Calculator then takes these inputs and returns the amount of money the user earned(just the interest, without adding it to the principal), and the total amount of money the user has now(principal + interest).
But, make sure to type in your inputs quickly. The Compound Interest Calculator disappears if you take too long!!.
